What to do with bones?
- Buy maps
- Increase max health
- Purchase checkpoint
- Upgrade number of consecutive attack swipes
- Upgrade dash to deal damage
- Upgrade air jump +1 flap
- Upgrade fireball damage (1->3)
- Upgrade shooting & dashing from wall

- GameState that is effectively load/reload (?)
- Main menu => New Game vs Continue
- Aim direction
- Pogo on down-hit
- (CRITICAL PERFORMANCE) Room loader/unloader mechanism (automatic from map file ideally, grid system)

- Arrow trap
- Enemy bat
- Enemy that splits up
- Enemy Orba
- Enemy Ironclaw (TBD Skeleton attack behavior)
- Enemy Archer

- Optimize background parallax objects
- Portals
- Bazar (fireball gate)
- Do not render out of frame
- Use flameSFX for tail
- Swift wind swirl on land / impact
- Mandatory combat rooms
- Boss fights?
- Symbols above gates to "link them" to eachother mentally
- Bug (that I kinda like) where attacking then jumping gives tall jump

Motion
- TBD opinions on ledge-walking
- One-way terrain to jump through
- Ground impact tilt forward animation

Mechanics
- Side quests: Collect artifacts, Collect bones, Liberate souls, Pay merchants, unlock portals.
- Should there be a dash?
- End goal is have max score with many bones. Death reduces your bone count by half or something. So does healing.
- Bones make boss gith easier?
- Time trials
- Bone collection
- Obstacle avoidance
- Chores?
- Catch bats?
- Press down --> 5 bones to heal?
- All bones lost on death?
- 3 HP base
- Heal ability?
- Combat room (link kills to gate)?
- Show bone count on empty slot for heal "cost"

VFX
- Enemy ground pound animation / pulse
- Swift wind swirl on land / impact
- Slash effect needs its own particle object
