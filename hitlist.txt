On Deck

- Boss fights?
- Symbols above gates to "link them" to eachother mentally

Motion
- TBD opinions on ledge-walking
- One-way terrain to jump through
- Ground impact tilt forward animation

Mechanics
- Side quests: Collect artifacts, Collect bones, Liberate souls, Pay merchants, unlock portals.
- Should there be a dash?
- End goal is have max score with many bones. Death reduces your bone count by half or something. So does healing.
- Bones make boss gith easier?
- Time trials
- Bone collection
- Obstacle avoidance
- Chores?
- Catch bats?
- Press down --> 5 bones to heal?
- All bones lost on death?
- 3 HP base
- Heal ability?
- Combat room (link kills to gate)?
- Show bone count on empty slot for heal "cost"

VFX
- Enemy ground pound animation / pulse
- Swift wind swirl on land / impact
- Slash effect needs its own particle object
